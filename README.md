Tutorial for GitHub 
My name is Nia and I am a computer science major. This is my first time ever doing anything like this as I was never inroduced to code or anything like it until senior year of highschool I did a project on artificial intelligence to inform my class on how bad it was and ended falling in love with it and writing about all the amazing things it had to offer to the world.
